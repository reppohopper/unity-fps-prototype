# unity-fps-prototype

This repo primarily hosts the script files and unity package for the work I did for a class at LWTech. 

A more complete demo of this project is available at my website, specifically on the [Unity FPS Prototype Project Page]([url](https://reppohopper.github.io/daniel-hopper-portfolio/unity-fps.html)).
